# Prediction-of-Air-Quality-Index-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

Air pollution is a global problem that affects public health, the environment, and the economy. In India, poor air quality is a particularly pressing issue that impacts millions of people. The goal of this project is to use data science techniques to analyze air quality data in Indian cities and develop insights into the factors that contribute to poor air quality.

The dataset used in this project contains information on air quality in Indian cities. It includes records of Air Quality Index (AQI) values and pollutant levels for the period from 2015 to 2020. The data was collected by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), an Indian government agency responsible for monitoring and controlling pollution levels in the country.

The dataset contains information for 26 different cities in India, with varying numbers of observations per city. For each observation, the dataset includes the AQI value, as well as the concentrations of 12 different pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, benzene, toluene, and xylene. The data is organized by city, year, month, day, quarter, day of the week, state, and zone. This dataset can be used to gain insights into air quality trends, and factors affecting air pollution, and to develop predictive models for future AQI values.

The predicted model is hosted as a website using python flask.
